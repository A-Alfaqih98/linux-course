Kernel Commands:
$ uname: print system information. use -r or -a flags to print the kernal version.
$ dmesg: print or control the kernel ring buffer, this will also contains logs from the hardware devices that the kernal detects.
$ udevadm: udev (device manager for linux kernel) management tool.
$ udevadm info: queries udev database for device information.
$ udevadm monitor: listen to the kernel udev events.
$ lspci: list pci(preferel controller interconect), list information of all psi devices configured in the system such as ethernet and video cards.
$ lsblk: list information about block devices, type disk is physical disk and type part is partition.
$ lscpu: display information about the CPU architecture. 32 bit cpu can adress and store 2^32 values in its registers (location in cpu that can be rapidly accessed, it's used to load data from memory and carry on arythmetic operations, e.g. add, subtract, multiply and so on). The 32 bits processor has a limitaion on maximum of 4GB. Sockets are the physical slots in the mother board where you can insert a physical cpu, cpu has multiple cores and each core has multiple threads. The total number of cpu or virtual cpus available in the system is the number of Sockets * Cores * Threads = CPUs, if 8 it means this system can run 8 thread at a time.

When a usb is inserted to a linux machine, the kernel device driver emits an event to the user space device manager demon called udev, then udev will create a device node assossiated with the newly attached drive in th /dev file system.
