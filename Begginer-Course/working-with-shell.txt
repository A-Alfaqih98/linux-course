Some bash commands takes arguments and some dont.
For example echo command takes arguments:

$ echo Hello Word

And uptime, show information about how long the system been running for after the last reboot.

$ uptime

Commands also can take options after it which could be called switch or a flag, which proceeds a hyphen (-) after the command.
For example to print without the trailing line after it use -n flag:

$ echo -n Hello Word

To know what options that a command has, refer to the command help options or man pages.

There are two types of linux commands, Internal (Built-In) and External, there are 30 built-in linux commands.
External command are binary programs or scripts, they can come with the linux distribution or either created or installed by the user.
To know a command is internal or external use the type command:
$ type echo => echo is a shell builtin
$ type mv => mv is /usr/bin/mv

___________________________________________________________________________

Basic Linux Commands:
$ echo: display line of text, or the value of the ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE if it starts with dollar sign ($ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE), (e.g. $HOME and $SHELL).
$ env: check all environment variables
$ export: set a new environment variable (export OFFICE=caleston), if done without export, it will be a session variable not environment one.
$ cd: change directory (running cd without argument will go to home directory regardless of the current location)
$ pwd: print working directory
$ mkdir: make directory (takes folder names as arguments or folder paths such as existing-parent/child) or use -p flag to create the parent directory as well if not already created.
$ type: check command type.
$ uptime: Shows information about how long the system been running for after the last reboot.
$ pushd: push directory to a stack, what ever cd commands are made, they won't change this stack it will only be changed with pushd to add to stack and popd to remove from it.
$ popd: pop directory to remove directory from top of the stack, and go to the next top directory in the stack.
$ mv: move file or directory, also used to rename files and directories. It takes two arguments src and destination.
$ cp: copy file or directory. It takes two arguments src and destination folder, use -r (recursive option) to copy non-empty directories.
$ rm: delete file or directory, use -r (recursive option) to remove non-empty directory.
$ cat: concatenation files and print on the standard output.
$ touch: change file timestamps (last update time), or create new file.
$ file: determine file type.
$ more: To display file in a scrollable manner, (Enter to go down one line), (Space go down one page), (b go up one page), (/ search text), (q to quite), more load the whole file at once which not good when dealing with larger files.
$ less: opposite of more. (up-arrow go up one line), (down-arrow go down one line).
$ ls: list directory contents. -l option will get long list (which gets access mode, ownerships, last access time). -a option will list all files including the hidden ones. -t to sort by time or -tr to reverse sort by time, can also be used with long list (-lt or -ltr).
$ whatis: display one-line manual page descriptions.
$ man: interface to the system reference manuals. also --help or -h option can be used after command to show some features.
$ apropos: search the manual page names and descriptions. (example: apropos modpr)
$ watch: execute a program periodically, showing output full-screen.
$ chsh: change shell.
$ alias: alias a command (alias dt=date).
$ history: get the previously ran commands.
$ which: locate a command.
$ locale: check system locals. (locale is a set of environmental variables that defines the language, country, and character encoding setting).

/ is the root directory

It's possible to specify a directory by either the relative path (from current directory) or by absolute path (starting from the root directory /home/...)

___________________________________________________________________________

Symbols:

$ >: Redirection (forward arrow), if done after cat followed by a file it will wait for user input to that file, and exit with (ctrl + d) which will replace the content of the file with the input.

$ >>: Double Redirection will append the redirected content to the destination.

Default shell
- The default shell in linux is bash, this can be checked using the echo $SHELL command.
- The default shell can be changed using the chsh command (change to /bin/sh for example).

___________________________________________________________________________

- You can see what bash auto completion gives you by pressing tab.

___________________________________________________________________________

To make variables persistent, add them add them to ~/.profile or ~/.pam_environment

- When a user issues an external command to the shell the shell use PATH to search for this external command,
type (echo $PATH) to see the directories defined in the PATH variable. If the PATH variable does not has the location or path of a command, running this command will result in a failure. 

- Use which command to check the location of a command, if no result that means the command is not found

- Add a command to path command using export PATH=$PATH:/opt/obs/bin

___________________________________________________________________________

- Bash prompt is the line you see and type after in bash, it can be customized to show different Information such as user and host names.

- It also shows the pwd.

- Dollar sign symbol ($) is for user prompt.

- Bash prompt is set and controlled by a set of special shell environment variables, most common one is $PS1.

- Current at print echo $PS1: \[\]\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ \[\].

- Change the $PS1 variable to change the bash prompt.

- Change to show date, time, user@host, and current working directory: export PS1="\d \t \u@\h:\w $ "
