Introduction to Package Manager

* There are hundreds of Linux distibutions in use today, they can be categorized by the package manager they uses:
For Example:
1- Red Hat and Centos, are based on .RPM, they are known as .RPM base distribution.
2- Dibian family including Ubuntu, Dibian, and Linux Mint, make use of the Dibian pacakge managers such as the DPKG and APT (A newer fronend for the DPKG system). APT-GET (The traditional frontend for the DPKG system)

* A package is a compressed archive that contains all the files that are required by a particular software to run.

* One of the reasons to use a pckage manager is that each Linux distribution has its own sets of tools and libriries and software and posibly different linux kernel. As a result of this a linux program may not run the same way from one system to another. To Fix this problem, packages includes a manifist of dependencies or list of program inversions that must be satisfied for a packaged software to run correctly on a given computer.


* A package manager is a software in a linux system that provide a consistent and automated process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing packages from the operating system. Some of the essential functions of a package manager are:
1- Insure package integrity and authenticity by varifying their digital cerificates and check sums.
2- Simplifying the entire package management process.
3- Grouping packages by function.
4- Managing dependencies to insure a package is installed with all packages that it requires.

.RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)

.RPM has 5 basic modes of operation, to run each mode can be run rpm followed by a certien option:
1- Installing (rpm -ivh talnet.rpm)
2- Uninstalling (rpm -e talnet.rpm)
3- Upgrading (rpm -Uvh talnet.rpm)
4- Query (rpm -q talnet.rpm), all packages information are stored in rpm database found in var directory.
5- Varifying (rpm -Vf talnet.rpm)

Note: RPM Dose not resolve package dependencies on its own, that why we use higher package manager called YUM which depends on .RPM.

YUM (Yellowdog updater modified): Can install any dependant packages to get the base package installed. t depends on Software Repositories that be be eaither local (Installed in your laptop) or on a remote lcoation that can be accessed through transfer protocol
such as FTP/HTTP/HTTPS. The information about the repository is saved under a configuration file saved under /etc/yum.repos.d. Under the hood yum still use rpm package manger to install packages.

Sometimes a Redhat system may not have certain package or it only has and old version so you can make a new repo file under /etc/yum.repos.d and point it to a non offical or third party repo, e.g. /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo.

Sequence of steps involved while installing a pcakge (after yum intall command):
1- yum runs a transaction check, check whether the package is installed in the system or if it need to be updated.2
2- Then the transaction summary is displayed for the user to review, and ask to enter y if want to continue. (-y will skip this).
3- Now yum will download and install the nessesary RPMs to the linux system.

Common YUM Commands:
- yum install: to install a package.
- yum remove: to remove a package. if used without arguments, it will update all the packages installed inw the system, it will also look for new dependant packages to be installed.
- yum update: to update a command.
- yum repolist: shows all the repos added to the system.
- yum provides scp: To figur which package should be installed for a specific command to work (scp the command we want info about).

DPKG (Dibian Package Manager):
.DPKG has 5 basic modes of operation, to run each mode run rpm followed by a certien option:
1- Installing or Upgrade (dpkg -i talenet.deb)
2- Uninstalling (dpkg -r talnet.deb)
3- List Packages (dpkg -l talnet)
4- Status (dpkg -s talnet).
5- Varifying (dpkg -p <path to file>), this will display details about packages.

Similar to RPM, DPKG does not honor dependency when it comes to package management. Thus we use higher level Debian pacakge managers such as apt and apt-get. Noting that apt does not rely on apt-get nighther the oposite, we will focus on apt since it is more advanced and user friendly.

Some common apt commands:
- apt update (Refresh the software repository, this command is used to download package inforamation from all available sources), run this command after installing the os or after installing new sources.
- apt upgrade (Used to install available upgrades of all packages on the system from the sources configured).
- apt edit-sources (update the repositories, this opens the /etc/apt/sources.list-files), or just open them using a text editor such as vi editor.

* Once the repositories have been set up, you can make use of it to run apt commands.

- apt install talnet
- apt remove talnet
- apt search talnet (used to look up a package in the repository)
- apt list | grep telnet (list all packages)
