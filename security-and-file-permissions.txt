Linux Accounts


* Every user in linux has an associated account, the user account maintains information such a username, password used to log in to the system. Also, each user has a unique identifier in the system called UID.
Moreover, account more information that the user account holds includes the home directory of the user, and default shell, these information about a user account can be found in /etc/passwd.

* Linux group is a collection of users, it is used to organize users based on common attributes such as row or a function. Information about groups can be found in /etc/group, each group has a unique identifier called the GID. One user can be a part of multiple groups.

* If a user is created without a group, the system assigns the user to a group with the same id and name as the user id, that is called the primary GID of the user.

* Types of Account:
1- User Account: Refers to an individual people who needs access to the linux system.
2- Super Account (root): This user has unrestricted access and control over the system including other users, and it has the UID of 0.
3- System Account: Are usually created during the os installation, these are for use by for software and services that will not run as the super user. UID of system account are usually < 100 or between 500 and 1000. And the usually don't have a dedicated home directory and if they do, it will not be under /home.
Examples of system account include ssh and mail.
4- Service Account: Are created when services are installed in linux, for example nginx.

* sudo make run commands as the root user (change user to root user and run the command), or the su {username} command can be used to switch to any other user, if no arguments were given it will switch to root user. However, this is not recommended, it's better to use sudo instead.

* When trusted user proceeds a command with sudo to gain administrative access, they will be prompted to enter their own user password.

* The default configuration for sudo are defined under /etc/sudoers. These policies can be updated using the visudo command
