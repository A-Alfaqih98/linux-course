Log into local & remote graphical and text mode console

* There are four types of logging in:
1- Local text-mode console
2- Local graphical-mode console
3- Remote text-mode login (OpenSSH). Before ssh there was telnet communication protocol, but it isn't encrypted. 
4- Remote graphical-mode login

commands:
$ ip a: used to check which ip your machine uses (check for inet section ip)

Read and use system documentation

* Use --help before jumping to man pages to save time, unless you want to dive deep into the command.

* The top of --help and man pages, include the syntax of the command.

* man provides other options apart from printing the whole manual page, such as whatis with -f and apropos with -k, to check these option, look at the manual of the man command (man man). Note that apropos needs a database that can be created manually using $sudo mandb command.

* Use the -s command with either apropos command or man -k followed by range of man sections numbers like this: $man -k -s 1,5 <word> to get the results from targeted sections.

* Also, When using man man command you will see that you can select the section which of you want a manual page from e.g. Executable, System Calls, library, and so on. This helps when there are multiple commands with the same name, for example: man 1 printf.

* To save time, use tab to auto complete a command, or after typing a command press "space" then double tab to get some recommended options for this command. This could even work for nested commands.

commands:
$ mandb: create or update the manual page index caches.

Create and Manage Links

* File systems like ext4 and others, keep track of data in files with the help of "Inode". A file data blocks could be scattered all over the desk, and Inode remembers where all pieces are stored as well as tracking the metadata, things like permission and access time.

* Every file has an Inode number that can be seen using the stat command, though we use the file path instead cause it's simpler. The file point to the Inode number and inode point to all blocks of data that we require.

* When a file is created, linux will group this file's data blocks under Inode number, then a hard link is created to link the file name/path to the Inode number. The number of links for a file can be shown by the stat command.

- Hard Links

* Instead of copying the file for another user for instance, we can hard link it to them to save the space of duplicating the data in the disk.

* Hard link will create a file that point to the same Inode as another file.

* If there are more than one hard link for a file, deleting one of them will not delete the the Inode, thus the other file will not be affected. If the last link is deleted, and the Inode has zero links, the data itself will be erased from the desk.

* limitations and considerations of hard links:
1- Hard links can only be made to normal files, but not directories.
2- Hard links can only be made for files in the same file system.
3- Make sure to have the right permission to write to the destination.
4- When hard linking a file, make sure all users involved has access to that file.
5- Changing permissions for one of the hard links will change the permissions for other links, since it will change the permissions for the Inode.

Command:
$ ln <source file path> <destination file path>: create a new file and hard link it to an existing Inode which is the source file Inode.


- Soft Links

* Soft link or a symbolic link will create a file that points to a path. Unlike hard links, soft links will not point to the Inode. It's almost like a text file with the path to another file or directory inside.

* When using ls -l command to view a folder the soft link in it, we can see that the file type is l (soft link), and the file name points to another file.

* The permission of a soft link does not matter, thats why all permissions will be given to the soft link. The original file permission will be applied when dealing with the soft link.

* Changing the name of the original file, will break the soft link, you can see broken links highlighted in red in the output of ls -l command.

* It's possible to make a soft link for a directory as well as making soft links between files in two file systems.

File Permissions

* Any file or directory is owned by a user, and only the owner of the file and root user can change permission of a file.

* User can only change the permission to a group that he belongs to.

* The user owner can only be changed with $chown by the root user.

* Since directories data is the files inside it, the read (r), write(w), and execute(x) permissions, does not work the same way as files. In directories here is how permission bits work:
r- Read directory, run commands like ls to view the content of a directory
w- Write to directory, begin able to create and delete files in a directory with commands like mkdir and rm.
x- Execute into directory, being able to $cd into the directory.

* If a directory is accessible, the read and write permissions will be enabled.

* $stat command shows the permission in both symbolic and octal form. Note that the first octal value will be special permission fo set uid and set gid and the sticky bit.

* Octal permission values are calculated in binary: rwx = 1 1 1 = 7. Or use the octal table: r=4, w=2, x=1.


commands:
$ groups: print the groups a user is in.
$ chmod g=r <file name>: with equal symbol (=) it's possible to set group permission only to read ,regardless of the previous permissions, leaving the permission bits will remove all permissions This works for all permissions and parties.
